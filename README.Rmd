## Description

__swcrt__ is an R package that helps produce diagrams of stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial (SW-CRT) designs, like those advocated for inclusion when reporting SW-CRTs by [Hemming *et al.* (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.k1614).
The produced diagrams can be exported in .docx, .png, and .pptx formats.

## Getting started

The latest development version of __swcrt__ available from [GitHub](https://github.com/) can be installed with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("mjg211/swcrt")
```

An introductory example of how to make use of the package's core functionality can be found below. 
More detailed support is available in the package vignette, which can be accessed with `vignette("swcrt")`.
For further help, please contact [Michael Grayling](https://www.newcastle-biostatistics.com/people/michael_grayling/) at michael.grayling@newcastle.ac.uk.

## Example

As a basic example, we consider reproducing the 4-cluster 5-time period design used in the trial reported by [Bashour *et al.* (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2013-002674).
First, create the design matrix using `design_sw()`:
```{r}
X <- design_sw(clusters_per_time_period = c(0, 1, 1, 1, 1),
               labels                   = c("C", "I"))
```
Here, we've labelled the two conditions `"C"` and `"I"` to reflect their role as the control and intervention arms. The input `clusters_per_time_period` is used to specify the design; a single cluster switches in time periods two through five.
We can now plot this using `draw_sw()`, exporting in .png format:
```{r}
png_of_design <- draw_sw(X, make = "png")
```
The resultant .png looks as follows:
